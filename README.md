Hello! This is the code for my personal blog.
It is powered by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

##Fork It!

The code I created for this blog is open and you can use it the way you want. The only thing I’d like to ask is to shoot me an email if you intend to make use of it and also, since I’ve spent some time on the looks (even though is super simple) would be great if we didn’t have the same visual identity.
